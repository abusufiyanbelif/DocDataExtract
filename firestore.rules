/**
 * ======================================================================
 * Firestore Security Rules
 * ======================================================================
 *
 * Philosophy:
 * This ruleset employs a mixed-privacy model designed for security and functionality.
 *
 * 1. Publicly Readable Data:
 *    - `settings`, `donations`, and published `campaigns`/`leads` are publicly readable.
 *    - This allows for public-facing pages (like campaign summaries) to be rendered
 *      without requiring user login.
 *    - `list` operations on `campaigns` and `leads` are public, but the client-side
 *      queries are responsible for filtering based on public flags.
 *
 * 2. Authenticated Writes:
 *    - ALL write operations (create, update, delete) on ANY collection require the
 *      user to be signed in. There are no public write rules.
 *
 * 3. Role-Based Access:
 *    - Administrative actions (like managing users or lookups) are protected by the
 *      `isUserAdmin()` function, which checks for an 'Admin' role in the user's
 *      profile document in Firestore.
 *    - Most write access for authenticated non-admins is handled by the application's
 *      UI, which hides/shows controls based on the user's specific permissions object.
 *      The rules provide a baseline "must be signed in" check.
 *
 * 4. User-Private Data:
 *    - A user's own profile document at `/users/{userId}` is readable only by that user
 *      or an admin.
 *    - Listing all users is restricted to admins to prevent user enumeration.
 *
 * 5. Data Integrity:
 *    - Key identifiers (`id` fields, `userId` fields) are immutable on update to
 *      prevent documents from being moved or reassigned.
