src/lib/modules.ts(75,29): error TS2352: Conversion of type 'readonly [{ readonly id: "summary"; readonly name: "Summary"; readonly permissions: readonly ["read", "update"]; }, { readonly id: "ration"; readonly name: "Ration Details"; readonly permissions: readonly ["read", "update"]; }, { ...; }, { ...; }] | readonly [...]' to type 'any[]' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.
  The type 'readonly [{ readonly id: "summary"; readonly name: "Summary"; readonly permissions: readonly ["read", "update"]; }, { readonly id: "ration"; readonly name: "Ration Details"; readonly permissions: readonly ["read", "update"]; }, { ...; }, { ...; }]' is 'readonly' and cannot be assigned to the mutable type 'any[]'.
